## Overview

- **`consN`** – repeats an item by count times in front of a list  
- **`duper`** – duplicates each element of a list by param count  
- **`expand-sublists`** – expands sublists using super-duper  
- **`super-duper`** – handles exansion and duplication calls as well as checking if element in list is a sublist or just an atom



## How I ran it on my mac
- brew install mit-scheme
- cd into the directy of where the file is
- scheme --load hw1.scm

## Reflection
This assignment was fairly tough, my understaing of recursion was definelty tested, I did start off with almost all my logic just in one function but I eventually modularized everything since I eventually ran into bugs, expecially handling sublists within lists, as it hard thinking about when to recurse further and how to process nested structures without losing track of the overall list.
